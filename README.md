EXISTING SYSTEM 
a) Data redundancy and formatting: The various files are likely to have different formats and therefore lead to redundancy and inconsistency.
b) Maintaining registers is costly: Traditionally, documents have been stored in batches, and they field in file cabinets and boxes. A numerical system is they assigned. Specifically, a consumer number assigned to organize the files.
c) Error prone: Existing systems are error prone, since manual work is required. More time is consumed and errors may propagate due to human mistakes.
d) Low security feature: Due to maintenance of records manually and shared and could view easily by anyone. Also, these could be possible loss of data and confidential information due to some disaster in the form of fire, theft, etc.








 
Problem Areas of Existing System
1.	Repetitive and Messy Data:
 The current system has too many duplicate files and mismatched formats, making it hard to keep the data organized and consistent.
2.	Expensive to Maintain:
 	Storing information in physical registers or files takes up space and money. It also 	requires special systems to organize these records, which adds to the cost.
3.	Prone to Human Errors:
 Since the system depends heavily on manual work, there is a high chance of mistakes. 	These errors take extra time to fix and can cause bigger problems.
4.	Weak Security:
 	Manually kept records can be easily accessed by anyone, which puts private data at risk. 	They are also vulnerable to being lost or damaged by disasters like fires or theft.






 
Need for the new system:
1.	Enhanced Interactivity:
The system will promote community building through features like comments and likes encouraging interaction between bloggers and readers.
2.	Content Security and Control:
Users will have full control over their blogs, with secure login and the ability to block or 	delete unwanted content. This ensures a safe and private environment for blogging.
      3. Rich Multimedia Support:
Current blogging platforms often have restrictions or complicated processes for adding 	images and videos. Blognest will allow users to seamlessly include images and videos in 	their blogs, making posts more engaging and visually appealing.
